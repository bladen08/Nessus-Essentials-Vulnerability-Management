# Nessus Essentials Vulnerability Management

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I Install and configure Nessus Essentials for credentialed vulnerability scans on Windows 10 hosts. Implement a comprehensive Vulnerability Management function on sandbox networks, covering discovery, prioritization, assessment, reporting, remediation, and verification. Successfully conduct vulnerability assessments with Nessus, actively remediating identified vulnerabilities.

<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
To begin, I started up a Windows 10 virtual machine using VMware, then I downloaded Nessus essentials and created an account. Once they were finished installing, I ran the command “ipconfig” in the VM command prompt to see what the ip address of the VM is, so I can scan that specific ip address for vulnerabilities.

After that, I went back to my original workstation and ran the “ping” command for the ip address of my VM wokrstation to make sure that I can communicate to it, but I kept receiving the “request timed out” error.

To get around that, I disabled the firewall in the “domain, private, and public profile” in Windows defender firewall in my VM.

Now I am able to successfully ping the ip address of my VM.

Next I went to Nessus and clicked “new scan” and then clicked “basic network scan” 

 I then entered “Windows 10 Single Host” as the name for my new scan and entered the ip address of my VM for my target.

<br/> I then clicked save and ran the scan.
 After the scan is finished, I can see that I only have one medium vulnerability in my VM.

I clicked on the “Vulnerabilities” tab to take a closer look. I can see here that the “medium” vulnerability is due to SMB signing not required in my VM. When SMB signing is enabled, it adds a digital signature to SMB packets. This helps ensure the integrity and authenticity of SMB packets during communication between clients and servers. For most organizations, this is very important. Below the description, you can see the solution to remediate the vulnerability and enable SMB signing as a requirement.

Here are the rest of the vulnerabilities detected throughout the scan. These are all labeled as “INFO” which means that it may not necessarily be a vulnerability, but it should be something I should be aware of.

Here we can see that Nessus was not able to authenticate to the VM because I did not provide any credentials. Underneath output, it says that “SMB was detected on port 445, but no credentials were provided” which means that it is listening on port 445, but ultimately no credentials were provided.

Next I am going to set up my VM to accept authenticated scans, provide credentials to Nessus and re-scan with credentials to compare the results. First step I did was I launched “services.msc” and enabled “remote registry” so the scanner can connect to by VM’s registry and detect insecure configurations.

Next I went to the “User account control settings” and disabled notifications to changes on my VM, which obviously is not good, but I did so to be able to perform a more intrusive scan.

To further disable user account control I went to registry editor and followed the this pathway Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System. Withing the system folder I created a new “DWORD” named “LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy” I then set the value to 1 and then restarted my VM.

I then went back to Nessus and clicked on my Windows 10 scan, I then clicked on more>configure, and then clicked on credentials and entered my VM windows credentials, saved and then scanned my VM one more time.

Immediately I can see there are much more vulnerabilities, this shows how important it is to run credential scans on your workstations because there could be several critical vulnerabilities that your non-credential scan may not detect.

Next, I just downloaded a very old and outdated version of Firefox, and ran the vulnerability scan in Nessus again. Now there are even more vulnerabilities detected.

When I go to the remediation tab, it shows that the biggest actions I can take to remediate these vulnerabilities is 1. Upgrade Firefox, 2. Upgrade Microsoft Edge, and update other applications.
